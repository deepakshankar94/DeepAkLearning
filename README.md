# DeepAkLearning (DAL)
> I know it is a bad pun but coudn't help it! What is deep learning without it's forced acronyms( i.e [DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03605) etc.)! Now let's cook up some (DAL)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal#Use] :)

This is just a random exercise to see if I can create a basic DL library (hopefully with GPU accel) and maybe implement some papers using it! Let's see how far I can take this.

Libraries allowed
* matplotlib

TODO
- [x] Start the library :) `11/29/22`
- [] Create a basic computaional graph implementation
